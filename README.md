# MEET APP

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This meet app combines serverless architecture with Progressive Web App (PWA) features, offering instant loading, offline support, and cross-platform compatibility. Following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, priority is given to quality code and user-centric features. Additionally, this app includes data visualization with charts, enhancing user experience and insight into event data.

## Key Features:

### ● Filter Events by City

**User Story**: As a user, I want to filter events by city so that I can find events happening in my preferred location.
**Scenario:**
Given the user is on the event page, When the user selects a specific city from the filter dropdown, Then only events in the selected city should be displayed.

### ● Show/Hide Event Details.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to view event details, but also have the option to hide them to focus on the event list.
**Scenario**:
Given the user is viewing event details, When the user clicks on the "Hide Details" button, Then the event details should be hidden, and only the event list should be visible.

### ● Specify Number of Events.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to specify the number of events displayed on the page to manage the amount of information shown.
**Scenario**:
Given the user is on the event page, When the user selects a specific number from the dropdown to specify the number of events, Then only the specified number of events should be displayed on the page.

### ● Use the App When Offline.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to use the app even when I'm offline so that I can access event information regardless of my internet connection.
**Scenario**:
Given the user has previously loaded event data, When the user loses internet connection, Then the app should continue to display previously loaded event data without requiring an internet connection.

### ● Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to easily access the app by adding a shortcut to my device's home screen for quick access.
**Scenario**:
Given the user is using a mobile device to access the app, When the user selects the "Add to Home Screen" option from the browser menu, Then the app should be added to the device's home screen for convenient access.

### ● Display Charts Visualizing Event Details.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to visualize event details through charts to better understand event data and trends.
**Scenario**:
Given the user is viewing event details, When the user selects the "Visualize Data" option, Then the app should display charts or graphs representing event data such as attendance, popularity, or location distribution.

## USING SERVERLESS FUNCTIONS:

In the Meet app, serverless functions will be employed for various critical functionalities, including event notifications, real-time data processing, user authentication, and event recommendations. These functions offer a lightweight and scalable solution for backend processes, ensuring efficient resource utilization and dynamic scaling based on user demand. With serverless technology, the Meet app can deliver personalized experiences while maintaining cost-effectiveness and seamless scalability.
